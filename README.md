### Group members: Winnie Yeng, Ameera Alrahmah, Sophie Dang

## Introduction:
We are exploring how housing affordability and property characteristics vary across New York City properties. Our goal is to understand which areas are experiencing the fastest growth, how specific property features affect prices, and how proximity to amenities influences property values. Using publicly available datasets, our analysis compares property-level housing data to identify key patterns and trends in the NYC real estate market.

## Part I: Trends in Home Value Growth Across New York City Neighborhoods
As home values increase throughout the country, an individual might be curious as to how their local home values are changing. Thus, with our project, we want to lay out graphs and tables that present which neighborhoods in New York City have seen the most changes in home values and what factors are influencing these prices.

The first question of our project addresses the basic question first: which neighborhood has seen the most dramatic changes in home prices? From the csv file obtained via Zillow, it lays out every neighborhood in the country and their average home values each month of the year. To focus on neighborhoods solely in New York City, we filtered out the data so that it only displays information from New York City. 

From there we worked with the information to organize it into comprehensive tables and graphs to see the changes happening every year. The first visualization is a table, organized in descending order, to show which neighborhood has the highest percentage change from 2000 to 2025. Red Hook has an astonishing change of 1087.056%. This can indicate that housing values there grow fast, and those who had purchased homes there earlier, would probably gain a huge profit if they were to sell it now. Red Hook is around 250 percentages higher than the second neighborhood with the highest percentage change in home value, depicting its remarkable growth. 

For those who want to buy a house in a specific county, it is easier to identify which neighborhood is in each county by grouping it together by county. We have also organized this table to be in descending order so that buyers can see which county has the highest percentage changes and within these counties, which specific neighborhood has the highest changes. The previous table has shown that Red Hook has the highest percentage change, but this table helps identify that Red Hook falls in Kings County. The trend depicts that Kings County overall has seen the highest growth in home values, which could convince some to buy or invest in that area.

The next two graphs aim to present the overall trend in New York City. We made a table depicting the average home prices in New York City, and beside it is the growth or decline in prices from the previous year. This enables us to see which years were profitable and when the housing market was doing its best. For instance, from 2007 to 2011, we see the percentage change is in the negatives, conveying that the house prices were declining and the market wasn't doing its best during those years. This might lead someone to hold off selling their house until these percentages go back into the positives. The table helps outline the specific values and changes.

Average Home Price Per Year in NYC Neighborhoods: This graph shows the actual average price of homes across all New York neighborhoods for each year in the dataset. You can see the overall trend of home values, including periods of increase and decrease, and the approximate price range.

Average Home Price Change Per Year in NYC Neighborhoods: This graph shows the percentage change in the average home price from the previous year. This highlights the rate of growth or decline. For example, a 10% change means the average price increased by 10% compared to the year before, while a -3% change means it decreased by 3%. This graph is useful for understanding the volatility and speed of market changes.

## Part II: Property Characteristics and Average Sale Prices

The bar graph above shows that the average sale price will be greater for buildings with one residential unit or with five or more residential units. The average sale price is the least greatest in buildings with four residential units.
According to the scatterplot, while there are some data points that represent a positive relationship between the two variables, as they show that buildings with a smaller gross square feet have a smaller average sale price, the rest of the data does not show a strong trend and relationship between a building's gross square feet and sale price.
The bar graph shows that the average sale price is greatest for luxury hotels and second greatest for condo office buildings and transportation facilities. However, because there are so many building types, this graph is difficult to read well, especially for examining which building type has the lowest average sale price.
The bar graph above shows that the average sale price will be greatest with commercial buildings and is the lowest in residential buildings.
The scatterplot shows that residential buildings with 0 residential units and smaller gross square feet are similarly priced with residential buildings with 200-400 residential units and greater gross square feet. It also shows a positive relationship between the building's gross square feet and number of residential units, with the buildings with 400 residential units having a greater gross square feet.

## Part III: Proximity to Amenities and Property Prices

This section of the project focuses on understanding how proximity to key amenities, specifically subway stations and parks, affects property prices across New York City. The goal was to see whether being closer to a subway or a park is associated with higher home values and to explore how the type of park (waterfront vs. non-waterfront) influences prices.

We started by examining the relationship between property prices and distance to the nearest subway station. Using data that combined NYC property sales and subway locations, we calculated the distance from each property to the closest station. The results showed a very weak negative correlation, suggesting that while properties closer to subway stations tend to have slightly higher prices, the effect is small. The majority of homes in the dataset were already located within one mile of a subway, which may explain the limited variation.

Next, we analyzed the relationship between property prices and proximity to parks. The correlation pattern was similar to that of the subway analysis- there was a small negative relationship, meaning prices decreased slightly as the distance to the nearest park increased. Most properties were located fairly close to a park, and the graph showed a slight downward trend. This indicates that while proximity to parks does have some impact, it is not a strong predictor on its own.

To explore this further, we categorized properties based on the type of park nearby: waterfront, non-waterfront, or not near a park (using a 0.5-mile threshold). This provided a clearer picture of how park access relates to price differences. The results showed a significant contrast between the groups. Properties near parks were generally much more expensive than those not near any park, and non-waterfront park-adjacent homes were the most valuable- roughly twice as expensive as those near waterfront parks.

This finding was particularly interesting because one might expect waterfront areas to be the most desirable. However, the data suggests that non-waterfront parks may be located in more central or higher-demand residential areas, driving up property values. It’s also worth noting that there are far more non-waterfront parks than waterfront ones in the dataset, which could contribute to greater variability in these results.

Overall, the analysis highlights that while proximity to amenities like subways and parks plays a role in property pricing, the strength of this relationship varies. Accessibility to a park appears to have a stronger association with higher property values than subway proximity does. These results suggest that open green spaces contribute more to housing desirability in NYC’s dense urban environment, though further research with larger or more balanced data could provide additional insight.

## Conclusion:
Our analysis shows that New York City properties are shaped by both physical property characteristics and the surrounding environment. Housing prices change depending on the neighborhood, and their values also grow or decrease depending on that, conveying that the neighborhood one resides in plays a role in house value. Certain characteristics within various properties command higher listing prices. While the number of residential units and building type in a property play significant roles in property valuation, other features, such as gross square footage, do not show a strong correlation. Proximity to amenities, like the distance to subways and parks, can also have an effect on property prices in New York City. While subway proximity has little impact, homes near parks, particularly non-waterfront parks, tend to be significantly more valuable. Together, these findings highlight that neighborhood growth, property features, and proximity to various amenities interact to determine housing prices within New York City.
